                        <h3>Johandré de Beer</h3>
                        <p class="text-white">Johandré's journey through life has taken him to various places, but it's in Klerksdorp where he found his roots.
                            Raised by his inspiring mother and aunt, he's the middle child, nestled between an older sister and a younger one. </p>
                        <p class="text-white">
                            When he's not busy with his roles as a web developer in the making, a dedicated tutor in mathematics and physics (with an impressive success rate), 
                            a talented photographer, and a people manager at a real estate company, you'll often find Johandre immersed in educational YouTube videos, captivated by war series,
                            engaged in video games, or nurturing his cherished succulents.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-white">Johandre's aspirations extend far beyond his professional life; he has a deep desire to be a devoted husband and father, striving always to become the best version of himself. His heart is a treasure trove of kindness, always ready to lend a helping hand or offer words of encouragement to anyone in need.
                           Our love story began with the intervention of a mutual friend, Hennie. 
                           
                        <p class="text-white"> A chance meeting in a class we all attended led to conversations, shared moments, and unforgettable dates. Johandre's straightforwardness and gentle demeanor helped me break free from my protective shell. </p>
                        
                        <p class="text-white">I vividly remember the moment he confessed his feelings while we watched "Shawshank Redemption" and shared homemade chips. His sincerity and care have continued to define our relationship. He has a unique way of looking after me, especially when I'm unwell, and his words of encouragement have been a constant source of strength during tough times.
                           My life is beautifully intertwined with Johandre's, and I cannot imagine it any other way. He is my rock, my confidant, and the love of my life.</p>
                            

                        <p class="text-white">Join us in celebrating the incredible man who has captured my heart and completes our love story, Johandré.</p>

                            <p>Our fortuitous meeting was initiated by Johandre's proactive spirit. As the first to arrive in our class, 
                                he saw an opportunity to make a connection that could enhance our academic journey. 
                                <p>It was Hennie, our mutual friend, who initially led us to meet. Johandre struck up a conversation with me, 
                                    and it wasn't long before we exchanged numbers, initially for the purpose of staying connected for class.</p>
                                 <p>Little did we know that this seemingly ordinary introduction would blossom into something truly extraordinary. 
                                 Our journey together began with chats, outings, and the gradual realization of a deep and enduring connection that has since become the 
                                 foundation of our love story.</p>

                            <h3>He Proposed!</h3>
                            <p>On our 5th anniversary, I planned a day filled with surprises. After a relaxing spa session and a special manicure, we explored antique stores and bookshops. </p>
                                <p>Little did she know, inside one of the books was a hidden treasure—the engagement ring. After a heartfelt inscription and the ring's discovery, I went down on one knee and asked her to be mine forever. </p>
                                <p>To celebrate, we enjoyed her favorite seafood at an enchanting restaurant. It was a day filled with love, surprises, and the promise of a lifetime together."</p>

                            <h3>Love Story</h3>
                            <p>Our love story is a beautiful tapestry woven with countless memorable moments and shared experiences. From the day we first met in a classroom, thanks to Johandre's proactive spirit and the introduction by our mutual friend, Hennie, 
                                to the unforgettable holidays in places like Cape Town, Jacobsbaai, George, and Vaalwater, our journey has been marked by adventures, laughter, and cherished memories</p>
                            <p>But our love story isn't just about the highlights; it's about the unwavering bond that we've cultivated through every challenge we've faced. We stood together during the deep isolation of a pandemic that tested the world, 
                                and we even weathered a year apart, with Leané in Pretoria and Johandre in Potchefstroom. It was during those times of separation that our love grew stronger, and the anticipation of reuniting made our love even more profound.</p>
                                <p>Our journey has taken us from the classroom where we first met to baking fudge together to afford our rings—a testament to our commitment and determination. As we look to the future, we eagerly anticipate the adventures, challenges, and successes that lie ahead. Our love has already proven its resilience, and we have no doubt that it will continue to flourish.
                                    With each passing day, our story becomes more vibrant, and the promise of a lifetime together fills us with excitement and joy.</p>

                        <p class="text-white">Leané's vibrant personality and loving nature create a radiant presence wherever she goes. 
                            Born and raised in Randburg, South Africa, she cherishes her close-knit family, carrying their warmth with her in everything she does. 
                            While she briefly explored tennis and found it wasn't her passion, Leané adores the company of cats and pandas, finding solace in their charming companionship.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-white">As a true creative spirit, Leané channels her inner artist through acrylic and watercolor paintings and conquers intricate puzzles that challenge her brilliant mind. 
                                Her taste in music is as unique as she is, with a special fondness for sounds that resonate with her soul.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-white">In the academic arena, Leané shines brightly, holding a master's degree in chemical engineering and earning recognition for her groundbreaking research. 
                                Her unwavering ambition propels her on her path as a dedicated researcher, driven by her desire to make a meaningful impact.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-white">Beyond her achievements, Leané's boundless love and compassion set her apart. With an extraordinary ability to gather and support those with "broken wings," 
                                she transforms struggles into triumphs, leaving an indelible mark on the lives she touches.</p>
                            
                            <p class="text-white">Our journey together, marked by its ups and downs, has been a testament to the unique and beautiful connection we share. Leané brings light, love, and warmth to every life she touches,
                             and I am profoundly grateful to have her as my partner as we embark on this new chapter together.</p>
